Objective:
Develop an AI-powered chatbot that allows users to ask questions about documents and receive accurate, context-aware answers.

1️⃣ Problem Statement
🔹 Traditional document search methods rely on keyword matching, which often retrieves irrelevant or incomplete information.
🔹 Users have to manually scan long documents to find answers, which is time-consuming.
🔹 A need for a conversational AI that can understand context and provide precise answers.

2️⃣ Solution Approach
🔹 Built an AI-powered chatbot that can ingest documents, retrieve relevant information, and answer user queries accurately.
🔹 Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to improve response accuracy.

3️⃣ Step-by-Step Implementation
📌 Step 1: Document Ingestion & Preprocessing
✅ Users upload documents (PDF, TXT).
✅ The document is split into meaningful chunks using LangChain’s text splitter.
✅ Each chunk is converted into vector embeddings for efficient retrieval.

📌 Step 2: Embedding & Storage in Vector Database
✅ Used OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-ada-002) to convert text into numerical representations.
✅ Stored the vectorized chunks in ChromaDB, enabling semantic search.

📌 Step 3: Query Processing & Retrieval
✅ When a user asks a question, the system converts the query into an embedding.
✅ ChromaDB retrieves the most relevant document sections based on similarity search.

📌 Step 4: Answer Generation Using LLM (GPT-4)
✅ Retrieved document chunks are passed to GPT-4 via LangChain for response generation.
✅ The chatbot combines the retrieved text with LLM-generated responses for a highly accurate answer.

📌 Step 5: User Interaction via Chat Interface
✅ Built an interactive UI using Streamlit, where users can:

Ask document-related questions
Get AI-generated responses with cited document references
Upload new documents for instant querying
4️⃣ Technology Stack
✅ LangChain → For LLM-based document retrieval and response generation
✅ ChromaDB → For storing and retrieving document embeddings
✅ OpenAI (GPT-4) → For natural language understanding and response generation
✅ Streamlit → For user-friendly chatbot interaction

5️⃣ Key Challenges & How I Solved Them
